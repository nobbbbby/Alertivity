## 1. Discovery
- [x] 1.1 Inventory current helper text and footers in SettingsView and NoticePreferencesView
- [x] 1.2 Decide which controls need inline notes and place them adjacent to those controls

## 2. Design & Build
- [x] 2.1 Keep the General/Menu Bar/Notifications/Detection tabs; tighten spacing and attach notes to non-obvious controls
- [x] 2.2 Align each tab's content to the leading edge so form controls and helper notes share the same left baseline
- [x] 2.3 Update NoticePreferencesView wording/spacing to mirror the main Settings view for section order and essential notes
- [x] 2.4 Trim duplicated copy/dividers while keeping clarity for alerts and detection rules

## 3. Validation
- [ ] 3.1 Manually verify all toggles still bind to the correct @AppStorage keys
- [ ] 3.2 Check macOS Settings sizing/spacing and SwiftUI previews for the tidied layout
- [ ] 3.3 Confirm menu-driven settings and the main Settings window share consistent wording and essential notes
