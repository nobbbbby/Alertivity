## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add an Auto switch toggle and fallback icon type selector to menu bar settings.
- [x] 1.2 Update menu icon selection to pick the highest-activity metric with CPU > Memory > Network > Disk priority when multiple metrics are active.
- [x] 1.3 Enforce Show metric icon as on whenever Auto switch is enabled and keep it non-disableable while Auto is on.
- [x] 1.4 Keep Only show on high activity available/functional when Auto switch is on.
- [x] 1.5 Persist the new preferences, hydrate defaults, and ensure menu/UI bindings stay in sync.
- [x] 1.6 Manually verify auto switching across high-activity states, normal fallback behavior, and coexistence with Only show on high activity.
