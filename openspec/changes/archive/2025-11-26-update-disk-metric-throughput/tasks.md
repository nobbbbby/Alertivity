## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Capture disk read/write bytes per second using system counters that align with Activity Monitor
- [x] 1.2 Derive disk metric severity and auto-switch thresholds from throughput totals (read + write)
- [x] 1.3 Update metric presentation (menu/status, settings, notifications) to show throughput values and units
- [x] 1.4 Match the disk menu bar icon layout to the network icon style (custom rendered, no VStack in menu bar)
- [x] 1.5 Verify sampled throughput against Activity Monitor readings and adjust defaults/documentation
