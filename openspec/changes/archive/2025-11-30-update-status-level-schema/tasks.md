## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Update per-metric severity thresholds to include network and align with new bands
- [x] 1.2 Adjust global status computation to include network with severity-first priority and hysteresis/dwell
- [x] 1.3 Centralize status color palette and apply consistent tinting rules to status/metric icons
- [x] 1.4 Update auto-switch selection to use the shared severity + priority logic (with dwell if needed)
- [x] 1.5 Verify UI/notifications reflect network-triggered statuses and new tint behavior
